👨‍💻 I specialize in Backend development, with a strong command of C#, .NET, and proficiency in database management using MySQL and MongoDB.

🌱 Currently, I am expanding my skill set to encompass the latest technologies, including Node.js and Express. My expertise extends to front-end frameworks like React and Angular, ensuring a holistic approach to project development.

💼 I am open to collaborative opportunities on projects that integrate both backend and frontend technologies. If you have a project in mind or want to explore potential collaborations, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zivoradtrickovic/.

Exciting times ahead! Let's create something impactful together.
